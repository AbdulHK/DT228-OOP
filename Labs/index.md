OOP Programming Labs
====================

Lab 1
-----

Take the time to look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size

The first thing you need to do is complete the processing sketch we were working on in the class. Here are two shapes you can draw:

Try experimenting with colours!

Now try and figure out how to procedurally draw these patterns:

(Use variables as much as possible and use a loop in your solution)

Now try this one:

Finally try this one:

Notice the mouths

Feel free to experiment with colour!
