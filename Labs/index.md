OOP Programming Labs
====================

Lab 3
-----
Check out the example Spiral skeches and the various examples we made in the class on Monday. Use loops to recreate some of [these geometric patterns from everyday life](https://plus.google.com/u/1/photos/102641008582291248101/albums/6064398604152239873). 

Try and choose at least one image that uses just loops and at least one image that uses some trigonometry. Upload your examples through webcourses. I will award a prize for the most beautiful geometric patternms in Friday's tutorial class.

### Part 1

Make a rollover button in Processing. The button should be centred on the window and take up 30% of the width and height of the window. When you roll the mouse over the button, it should change colour from grey to blue:
Advanced! Make the button into a toggle (click on/click off) button. The button should go red when it is toggled on. In order to do this, you need to make use of the following method in your sketch:

```Java
void mousePressed()
```

This method will get called by the Processing framework whenever the mouse in pressed in the window where your sketch is running. Here is a youtube video with the completed sketch:

### Part 2
Implement a bouncing ball. It should move diagonally in your sketch and "bounce" off the walls.

Take the time to look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size

The first thing you need to do is complete the processing sketch we were working on in the class. Here are two shapes you can draw:

Try experimenting with colours!

Now try and figure out how to procedurally draw these patterns:

![Sketch](p2.png)

(Use variables as much as possible and use a loop in your solution)

Now try this one:

Finally try this one:

Notice the mouths

Feel free to experiment with colour!
