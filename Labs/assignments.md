# Object Oriented Programming Assignments 2014/2015

## Assignment 2
Rubric (from last year)

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | A project that looks great. All the art is procedural. There is audio. There a significant amount of clever animation or gameplay (if the project is a game). For example multiple "modes" or "screens". The assignment has lots of functionality. The code is organised into classes that make use of inheritance and polymorphism. There is lots of self written code. There is a lot of novelty and originality. All the code is written by the student. The student will have made use of vectors, transforms and classes to create autonomous elements in the assignment. The student might be loading content from text files. Everything works|
| 2.1 | The project looks good. There is a some animation or gameplay. The student put in a good effort. Some features may not be complete or entirely working. Probably no file IO, buts should be while loops, for loops if statements etc to control aspects of the assignment. The student may have used classes, but possibly not inheritance and polymorphism |
| 2.2 | The project looks so so, but is pretty basic. There should be some animation or gameplay but significant issues that the student couldn't resolve. The student may have used sprites instead of drawing everything. All the movement and animation code will be pretty basic for example colours changing each frame or movement controlled by variables that just update each frame. Little or no control code. There is not much code, maybe a page or two|
| Pass | All code in one file. Around a hundred lines of code. Looks like it could have been completed in an hour or two. Mostly drawing code, little or no controling code. Little or no functionality. Lots of code acquired from other sources |
| Fail | Something very basic that looks like it could have been completed in an hour. Just drawing code, no control code. The assignment has no interactivity. Significant unaddressed technical problems  |

## Assignment 1
Use the skills you are learning on the course to create a version of this game in Processing:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/DXlPvvmSogU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXlPvvmSogU)

Your game must include the following features:
- A splash screen, game screen and game over screen
- Player left and right movement
- Black blocks that fall from the top of the screen. If the player collides with one of the black blocks, they will loose a life. These should have random x positions. Ideally these should be evenly spaced
- When the number of lives goes to 0, it is game over.
- Random red blocks. If the player collides with one of these, they should gain a point.
- The game should speed up hence becoming more difficult as it goes on.

You should use the following features of Processing
- Variables, arrays
- Classes
- Loops
- Drawing primitives
- The if statement
- User input

Marking scheme:
- 50% of the marks for this assignment are for implementing the core game as presented in the video
- To get the remaining 50% of the marks you have to come up with your own additions to te core game. Some suggestions:
	- Power up blocks that speed up or slow down the gameplay
	- Extra life blocks
	- Additional gameplay. For example, the ability to shoot blocks
	- Sprites and nice graphics and sound
	- Running on an Android Phone or Raspberry Pi
	- Control with a Kinect, XBOX Controller or Leap Motion
	- Different types of block behaviours instead of just falling 
	- Any other crazy ideas you can come up with your self

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. You will not get any marks for any code that include that you get from books or from the internet. This assignment is about testing what *you* have learned and what *you* can do.
- Any suspected plagorism will be dealt with according to DIT General Assessment Regulations. This could mean expulsion from DIT. I will personally grade all assignments.
- There will be a feedback session after the assignment where you will have the opportunity to get individual feedback on your submissiona and have your mark explained to you.
- All assignments should be submitted through Google Classroom. Go to http://classroom.google.com and register using the code: codymp
- The date for submission is Tuesday 4 November @ 4pm. 
- All assignment submissions must be demoed in the lab that week.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you must submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.
